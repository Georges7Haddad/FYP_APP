# FYP APP
I implemented a cross platform application using Flutter for my Final Year Project.  
We will later be integrating our software in this application.
## Features  
We have a simple Home Screen with 3 buttons.  
- The first button is the settings button where we can change the theme of our application.  
- The second button takes us to a new screen where we can record audio tracks using the microphone and play it back.  
- The third button is for importing a song from the device.
